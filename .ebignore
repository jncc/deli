# the .ebignore file helps with elastic beanstalk deployment.
# by default, "eb deploy" uses .gitignore when building a deployment package,
# but our .gitignore excludes the built/ directory, which is what we want to package!
# when present, .ebignore is used by eb deploy instead of .gitignore
# let's deploy everything (ignoring the .git folder for good measure)
# but perhaps we could make this more efficient and only deploy what's necessary
# such as https://github.com/0xadada/dockdj/blob/master/.ebignore
