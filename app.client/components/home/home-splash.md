This site has been created to share LiDAR for Scotland data.

The site is in the very early stages of development and we need your help to make it better. As you use this portal, please send us your comments on how to improve the service you receive. We welcome your comments on any aspect of the system: functionality, content, interface and layout, and we will feed these into the development and release cycle.
