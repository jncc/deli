Welcome to the Scottish Remote Sensing Portal. 

Here you can find, share and reuse remote sensed data provided by Scottish public sector organisations. The Portal has been developed as a partnership between Scottish Government and Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). The site currently serves as hub for Scottish Public Sector LiDAR data which you can download by 10km tiles and web services.

For more information on the LiDAR data please contact [gi-sat@gov.scot](gi-sat@gov.scot).
